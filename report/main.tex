\subsection*{Question 1}

The only correct statement is C. The justification is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The variable \(x_1\) represents the time of day in blocks of 30
  minutes that partition a day into a finite number of intervals. The
  variable is therefore discrete. Since the intervals can be ordered,
  the variable is ordinal.
\item
  The attribute \(x_6\) is a ratio variable. The number of broken
  traffic lights is clearly a numeric variable. The cannonical zero of
  the variable is zero broken traffic lights.
\item
  The attribute \(x_7\) is a ratio variable for much the same reasons as
  for \(x_6\).
\item
  The congestion level is ordinal as it is a discrete variable that can
  be ordered.
\end{itemize}

The statements A, B, and D are all incorrect as they mistake \(x_1\) for something other than an ordinal variable.

\subsection*{Question 2}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
	\item This statement is correct since \(|26 - 19| = 7\) and that is the maximal difference among the respective coordinates of the two vectors.

	\item The metric is
	\[
		d_3(x_{14}, x_{18}) = \sqrt[3]{|26 - 19|^3 + |2 - 0|^3} \approx 7.05.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

	\item The metric is
	\[
		d_1(x_{14}, x_{18}) = |26 - 19| + |2 - 0| = 9.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

	\item The metric is
	\[
		d_4(x_{14}, x_{18}) = \sqrt[4]{|26 - 19|^4 + |2 - 0|^4} \approx 7.01.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Question 3}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
	\item The explained variance is
	\[
		\frac{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2}{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2} \approx 0.87.
	\]
	The statement is therefore correct.

	\item The explained variance is
	\[
		\frac{11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2}{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2} \approx 0.48.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

	\item The explained variance is
	\[
		\frac{13.9^2 + 12.47^2}{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2} \approx 0.52.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

	\item The explained variance is
	\[
		\frac{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2}{13.9^2 + 12.47^2 + 11.48^2 + 10.03^2 + 9.45^2} \approx 0.72.
	\]
	Thus, the statement is incorrect.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Question 4}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
	\item Such an observation will typically have a negative value as the high values of the third and fourth coordinates will make the negative coordinates of the principal component dominate. The statement is false.

	\item For much the same reasons as in A, such an observation will typically have a negative value. This statement is false.

	\item For such an observation, the positive value of the second coordinate of the principal component will dominate the sum in the dot product. The value will therefore typically be positive. The statement is false.

	\item The only negative coordinate of the principal component is the first one. As the observation has a low value in this position, and high values everywhere else, the dot product will typically be positive. The statement is correct.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Question 5}

We are given the following data:
\[
	n = 20000, M_{11} = 2, M_{01} = 5, M_{10} = 6.
\]
The Jaccard similarity of the documents is
\[
	\frac{M_{11}}{M_{11} + M_{01} + M_{10}} \approx 0.1538.
\]
The correct answer is A.

\subsection*{Question 6}

The probability \(p(\hat{x}_2 = 0 \, | \, y = 2)\) can be found by marginalizing on \(\hat{x}_7\). This results in the probability
\[
	p(\hat{x}_2 = 0 \, | \, y = 2) = p(\hat{x}_2 = 0, \hat{x}_7 = 0 \, | \, y = 2)
	+ p(\hat{x}_2 = 0, \hat{x}_7 = 1 \, | \, y = 2) = 0.81 + 0.03 = 0.84.
\]
The correct answer is B.
